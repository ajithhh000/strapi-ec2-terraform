Strapi Deployment on AWS EC2 using Terraform

This repository contains the implementation of task focused on provisioning AWS infrastructure using Terraform and deploying a Strapi application on an EC2 instance.

As part of the task, an EC2 instance, security group, and key pair were created using a Terraform module-based structure. A user data script was used to install the required dependencies on the EC2 instance. After provisioning, the instance was accessed via SSH and Strapi was deployed manually on the server.

All relevant Terraform configuration files were pushed to this GitHub repository, and a Loom video was recorded to demonstrate the setup and deployment process.
